The code is written in C++ which is general purpose high-level language , I have made this project as a part of my hobby and to explore the world of C++. It's designed to help you practice fundamental programming concepts and logical thinking.

## Rules to play Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two player game played on 3X3 grid. One player uses 'X' and other player uses '0'. The objective of the game is to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally, verically or diagonally the first player to do so wins the game.

Here's an example of the board:
   


## Features


- Interactive gameplay for two players.
- Win condition checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines.
- Display of the game board after each move.

## How To Play


## Limitations 

While the Tic-Tac-Toe game is functional and fun to play, it does have a few limitations and known issues that you should be aware of:

- **Crash on Invalid Inputs:** The program may crash if players input values are not within the range (1-9). I am actively working on improving input validation to prevent this issue. <br>
Also, you cannot enter a digit more than once for example if you have cell at position 3 you cannot use it again it will lead to unexpected results.
- **No GUI:** The version of the game is played on the command line interface (CLI) only. A graphical user interface (GUI) is not available on this release.
- **Lack Of AI-** This is a two player version of the game, and it does not include an AI opponent for single-player mode.
